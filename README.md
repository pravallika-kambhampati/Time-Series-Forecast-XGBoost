## Introduction

Time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in various industries, offering the ability to anticipate future trends and patterns based on historical data. In this project, we leverage the XGBoost Regressor, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm, to predict energy consumption accurately. The project involves extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation.

## Dataset

Our primary data source is the [Hourly Energy Consumption dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption), providing hourly records of energy consumption. This rich dataset serves as the foundation for our predictive modeling efforts.

## Train/Test Split

To assess the model's performance objectively, we partition the dataset into training and testing sets. This division ensures that our model learns from past data and generalizes effectively to unseen future data.

## Feature Engineering

Effective feature engineering is critical for modeling time series data. We create a range of temporal features, such as hour of the day, day of the week, quarter, month, year, day of the year, day of the month, and week of the year, from the timestamp. These features enrich the dataset, allowing the model to capture intricate temporal patterns.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a fundamental step in understanding the dataset's characteristics. We employ visualizations to gain insights into energy consumption patterns, identifying trends, seasonality, and potential outliers. EDA guides our feature selection and informs model design choices.

## Model Development

The core of this project is the implementation of the XGBoost Regressor. XGBoost is known for its high performance in handling time series data, thanks to its ability to capture complex relationships and adapt to changing patterns. We configure hyperparameters, including the number of estimators, early stopping rounds, and learning rate, to fine-tune the model's performance.

## Feature Importance Analysis

To unravel the key drivers behind energy consumption, we analyze feature importance. XGBoost provides a mechanism to quantify the contribution of each feature to the model's predictions. This analysis aids in understanding which temporal factors significantly influence energy usage.

## Model Evaluation

The performance of our model is evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), a standard metric for regression tasks. RMSE measures the accuracy of our predictions by quantifying the deviation between predicted and actual energy consumption values. Lower RMSE values indicate more accurate forecasts.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of the XGBoost Regressor in time series forecasting, highlighting its ability to handle complex temporal data patterns. By combining feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and rigorous model evaluation, we achieve accurate energy consumption predictions. This capability is invaluable for industries requiring precise demand forecasting and resource planning.
